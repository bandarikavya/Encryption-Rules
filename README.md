# Encryption-Rules

You are given some rules (<= 26 rules) which can be encrypt a string and interger K.
Write a program to find the Kth lexicographically smallest permutaion of encryption rules.
Note: You are given two strings S1 and S2(|S1| = |S2|)
Input Format:
First line: T (number of test cases)
First line in each test case: S1
Second line in each test case: S2 (|S1| = |S2|)
Third line in each test case: K

Sample I/P:
2
bcd
xyz
1
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
acdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
2

Sample Output:
axyzbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw
bacdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxzy
